A relatively simple setup compared to some other recent ones?

RBB is riding a motorcycle and is "popping a wheelie", which is known as a "stunt". So bears can do stunts just like certain other boybanders we know? Doesn't seem to be a shortage of stunts around here. An additional possible angle is that Harley Davidson motorcycles are known as Hogs, which originated from a team in the 1920s who had a hog as a mascot and would have it take victory laps. Putting a mascot on a Harley for a victory lap is a nice thought today, on National Coming Out day.

Fandom investigation led to speculation that the 25 decal on the bike refers to Josh Brookes, who [was kicked off the Australian X-Factor](http://saracha33.tumblr.com/post/130965437537){:target="_blank"}.
