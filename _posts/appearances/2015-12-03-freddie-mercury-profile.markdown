The official Twitter account has updated its profile image to [Freddie Mercury]({{site.baseurl}}props/freddie-mercury){:target="_blank"}. Freddie Mercury references have been all over the bears, RBB initially being called Teddy Mercury.

Fan pictures indicate that the guys are filming Carpool Karaoke with James Corden for the Late Late Show airing tonight. Is this a hint for what songs will be part of that segment?

Their profile location still says San Jose, CA. Come on guys, you're usually on top of that!
