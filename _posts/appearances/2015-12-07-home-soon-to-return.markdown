Well, well, Wellington. The location on the bears' Twitter profile is a bit interesting... *Home, soon to return......!* Seems like there's actually 2 locations there. RBB is home, and SBB is soon to return home? So I suppose it is pure coincidence then that Harry arrived back in the UK today, while Louis hasn't arrived there yet? Total coincidence. Yup. Right.

Is everyone making their final arrangements for when Louis arrives in the UK, the location is updated, and we all die?
