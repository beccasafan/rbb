The official Twitter account has updated its profile image to [Divine]({{site.baseurl}}props/divine){:target="_blank"}. Divine has been referenced a couple of times so far, and [Divine's eyebrow style]({{site.baseurl}}props/divine-eyebrows){:target="_blank"} has been used as a prop on RBB several times.

Shortly after, Harry tweeted *I have this some of the time.* which is a lyric from Hozier's *Cherry Wine*. The lyric preceeding this in the song is *And it's worth it, it's divine*. Well....ok....uh.... Sorry Harry, we know you're involved too and it's not just Louis, sheesh!
