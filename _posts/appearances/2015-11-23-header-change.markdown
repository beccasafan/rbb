While in [Mexico]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url tweets/2015/11/2015-11-25-tweet-30 %}){:target="_blank"}, RBB/SBB changed their Twitter header image. The image is an unseen picture of RBB at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at Queen's star. This is presumably honoring Freddie Mercury (the inspiration behind RBB initially being called Teddy Mercury because of his outfits).

Freddy Mercury was the lead singer of Queen, a British Rock band formed in the early 1970's. This is the 24th anniversary of his death. Mercury was/is an LGBTQ+ icon. He was HIV positive and died of complications from AIDS. His status as a celebrity helped raise awareness and discussion and research on the issue with the general public.

> Folks still struggle to place a label on Mercury (gay, bisexual, “flamboyant,” “theatrical,” “camp”) or agree if he was or wasn’t open about his sexuality. He famously said in 1974, “I am as gay as a daffodil,” but often distanced himself publicly from his male romantic partners (like Jim Hutton) and the LGBT movement. He was famously averse to interviews, but he wasn’t afraid to introduce elements of queer culture into his art. Take for example the band’s name (“I was certainly aware of gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it,” he said) and their dragged-out video for “I Want To Break Free,” above.
