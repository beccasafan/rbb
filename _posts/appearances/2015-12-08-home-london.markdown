So since [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url appearances/2015-12-07-home-soon-to-return %}){:target="_blank"}, people have been waiting for Louis to arrive back in the UK and for the bears to update their location. All day, people have been waiting for an update that simply said the location was "Home". Sometimes home isn't an actual place, ya know?

We sort of got that, but it is much wilder! As update accounts start reporting that Louis has landed back in the UK, people madly refresh the bears twitter page. The *crew member* running the bears is clearly in cahoots with Louis, who [tweeted the home emoji](https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson/status/674255721136041984){:target="_blank"}.

A day later, the Twitter location was updated to London.
