Continuing with the holiday spirit, the official Twitter account's profile image has been changed. The image now features [Divine]({{site.baseurl}}props/divine){:target="_blank"}, someone we've seen before, from a 1982 photoshoot for an In Touch For Men cover. Here are [several other photos](http://divineofficial.com/tagged/in-touch-for-men){:target="_blank"} from the same photoshoot.

We've seen [Divine]({{site.baseurl}}props/divine){:target="_blank"} featured before - are we missing a relevant detail?
