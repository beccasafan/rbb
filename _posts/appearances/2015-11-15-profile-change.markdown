Both the profile image and the header were changed on the twitter account. The profile picture is from [Chicago]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url concerts/2015/08/2015-08-23-chicago %}){:target="_blank"}. The same outfit was also used in [Milwaukee]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url concerts/2015/08/2015-08-25-milwaukee %}){:target="_blank"}, but the position of the money to the necklaces looks like Chicago to me. The fandom wasn't able to strongly agree on the significance, other than the American money referring to the US MITAM promotion leg kicking off.

The header image was changed to a picture of [Judy Garland]({{site.baseurl}}props/judy-garland){:target="_blank"}. Judy has been 'used' as a prop a few times. She was in the picture frame at the [Buffalo]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url concerts/2015/09/2015-09-03-buffalo %}){:target="_blank"}, and was referred to several times on the old Twitter account. The fandom has already discussed Judy's significance, and this seems to hold now.
