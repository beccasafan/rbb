RBB and SB are buckling down and doing some cleaning today! I think an important detail is that all the props indicate the bears are cleaning up something else, as opposed to [Detroit]({% post_url 2015/08/2015-08-29-detroit %}){:target="_blank"} where the props are things used to clean themselves.

There is a new Red sticker on the toilet, and while it isn't clearly visibly in photos I've seen, multiple reports from fans at the concert said it was an "angry" sticker.
