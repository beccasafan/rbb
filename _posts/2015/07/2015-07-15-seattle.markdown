Our friends Rainbow Bondage Bear and Sugar Bear were not present. The Hello Kitty chair and horse were all alone.

This was the first concert after the news of Louis becoming a dad and Briana's pregnancy was announced. Fandom speculation is that the bears missing the concert was related to this announcement.
