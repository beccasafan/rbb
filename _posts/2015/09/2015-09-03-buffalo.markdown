One of the picture frames has a photo of Judy Garland. She is a gay icon and has been called *The Elvis of homosexuals*. Judy portrayed Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Being a "friend of Dorothy" has been used by gay people as a way to identify each other. Dorothy's journey in the Wizard of Oz also has parallels to the gay community. As an additional random fact, this is [not the first time](http://100percentsassy.tumblr.com/post/94728937290/anchoredlou-bondagebear1d-its-all-coming){:target="_blank"}, or even [the second time](http://anchoredlou.tumblr.com/post/94696367164/bondagebear1d-of-course-i-love-you-no-i-havent){:target="_blank"} that RBB has referenced Judy Garland.
