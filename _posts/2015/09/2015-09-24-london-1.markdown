RBB and SB are holding hands...and getting married?!

The picture frame has a picture of Larry Grayson, a British TV personality who was closeted. His catchphrase was "what a gay day". The picture is signed "Love, Larry". It's the top image result when searching by name, but still...that's um...ok...? Eep!

A spotlight was also placed on the bears. Wanted to make sure everybody saw the bears and took notice, eh?
