Holy bears today!!

RBB is holding an iPhone, and there's a label that gives a phone number. It actually is the real number for the phone. Fans called and texted! The phone was hooked up to a charger so that it didn't run out of juice. Texts were visible on the lock screen as they came in. There's speculation that this is another part of them not being able to say anything, but letting the fans say it for them. Many 'Larry is real' texts were visible on the screen. They had to know that would happen...

RBB and SBB have [a friend](https://twitter.com/davidgrayontour/status/660160363216900096){:target="_blank"} with them today. Holding SBB's hand is [Furry Styles](https://twitter.com/davidgrayontour/status/660177596915798016){:target="_blank"}. So Jamie Lawson, who has been opening for 1D, has a tour mascot that is a teddie bear, and that bear is named Furry *Styles*? Right. Perfectly normal. Moving on.

RBB is hogging the spin action lately. Here's [a video](https://twitter.com/LarentsParadise/status/660186553776529408){:target="_blank"} taken by a fan.

After the concert, RBB [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/660249148487294976){:target="_blank"} the iPhone screen, showing 11480 text messages. The Passbook app was also visible, meaning that this is an iPhone 4 still on iOS7.
