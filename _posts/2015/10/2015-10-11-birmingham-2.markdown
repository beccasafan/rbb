A relatively simple setup compared to some other recent ones?

RBB is riding a motorcycle and is ["popping a wheelie"](){:target="_blank"}, which is known as a "stunt". So bears can do stunts just like certain other boybanders we know?

Fandom investigation led to speculation that the 25 decal on the bike refers to Josh Brookes, who [was kicked off the Australian X-Factor](http://saracha33.tumblr.com/post/130965437537){:target="_blank"}.
