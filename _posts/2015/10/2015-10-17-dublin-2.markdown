Posted by [the official twitter account prior to the concert](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/655394126368780288){:target="_blank"}, the bears are honoring the Irish today! RBB is wearing an Irish Step Dancer costume, and Sugar Baby Bear has a green sparkly fedora. We can also see a green happy sticker and what might be the edge of a picture frame. Will this be the only picture we get today, or will the bears appear at the concert today despite not being there yesterday at the same venue?
