Posted by [the official twitter account prior to the concert](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/655394126368780288){:target="_blank"}, the bears are honoring the Irish today! RBB is wearing an [Irish Step Dancer costume]({{site.baseurl}}props/irish-step-dancer-costume){:target="_blank"}, and Sugar Baby Bear has a [green sparkly fedora]({{site.baseurl}}props/green-sparkly-fedora){:target="_blank"}. We can also see a [green happy sticker]({{site.baseurl}}props/green-happy-sticker){:target="_blank"}. The bears apparently got all dressed up with nowhere to go, because they were not at the concert.

After the concert, it was discovered that the bears were not at the concert, but a setup was on display. The [pink chair]({{site.baseurl}}props/pink-hello-kitty-chair){:target="_blank"} and [horse]({{site.baseurl}}props/horse){:target="_blank"} were there. Hello, fandom freakout! The only other time we've seen this is [the show after the Babygate news broke]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015/07/2015-07-15-seattle %}){:target="_blank"}. This time, it looks like the horse might have a [saddle]({{site.baseurl}}props/saddle-and-bridle){:target="_blank"} and we also have the [pail]({{site.baseurl}}props/pail){:target="_blank"} with [Zloty (Polish money)]({{site.baseurl}}props/zloty){:target="_blank"} in the pail. We've seen Zloty [before]({{site.baseurl}}props/zloty){:target="_blank"}. Fandom speculation and the Polish money again raises the question of the boys leaving Simon and his money.

There is also a [phone]({{site.baseurl}}props/cell-phone){:target="_blank"}, a [Nokia]({{site.baseurl}}props/nokia-phone){:target="_blank"} again. Still leak speculation? The phone has a custom [label]({{site.baseurl}}props/custom-label){:target="_blank"} that reads "Nut Tree". A number of possibilities have been mentioned, but nothing that seems to be popular for a consensus.
