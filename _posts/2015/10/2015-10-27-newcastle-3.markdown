RBB is reading Joan River's book [I Hate Everyone...Starting with Me](http://www.amazon.com/I-Hate-Everyone-Starting-Me/dp/0425255891){:target="_blank"}. Rivers was a longtime LGBT ally, and was ordained to perform gay marriages. One of her catch prhases was "Can we talk".

Our "unknown" picture frame is back. After the second time it appeared, the fandom seemed decided that it was [Laurie Williams]({{site.baseurl}}props/laurie-williams){:target="_blank"} based on connections. Now that the picture is back for a third time, does that indicate we were wrong?

We've got spinning again - it looks like RBB and SBB really do share that. Today, RBB spins.
