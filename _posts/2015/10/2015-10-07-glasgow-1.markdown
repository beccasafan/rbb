The [third bear]({{ site.baseurl }}/props/third-bear) is back, as is the [red happy sticker]({{ site.baseurl }}/props/red-happy-sticker) we've seen with this bear before.

Both RBB and the third bear are wearing a watch.

The picture frame has a photo of Quentin Crisp. Crisp worked as a rent-boy and had feminine tendencies like painting his nails and wearing make-up. Another fun fact - Crisp was a raconteur. Now whose Twitter bio have we seen that in, hmm... Another tie-in to previous themes is that Crisp criticized Princess Diana.

The third bear is in a suit with a bible. Fandom speculation has mentioned priest/minister and judge. RBB is wearing Scottish Dress Tartan, typically used for big or special occasions. There are several possibilities we've seen at prior concerts: wedding, court, war?

The gardening book could mean seeding? As in stories being seeded in the press and with fans?

Irn Bru is a Scottish drink, and the can is labeled sugar-free. Freedom is something we've seen referenced in the past. They are said to innovative and controversial marketing techniques, which could possibly relate to 1DHQ. Does it relate to Sugar Bear / Louis?
