RBB and SBB dressed up for Halloween! RBB still has his phone. A fan [recorded the voicemail greeting](http://pumpkinau.tumblr.com/post/132286749108){:target="_blank"} when calling the number.

RBB is spinning on a pumpkin. Dressed up as a vampire, is this just a fun costume, or does it reference vampires not liking the sun? Or rather, The Sun and its recent article...? Fans have taken to calling RBB 'Drag-cula' today, given the Divine eyebrows and the black skirt.

The watch has the current UK time on it. The future is now?

After the concert, RBB [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/660613194415808512){:target="_blank"} his first text post, saying:

> Keep in touch. Back very soon.  
> Much love & affection.  
> Stay safe.  
> Thanks to you all.  
> RBB & SBB. xxxxx  

An image with the Terminator's famous quote "I'll be back" was also included in the tweet.
