Hello there, bears! Quite the level up we've seen from them lately.

RBB is wearing a football kit today, representing Newcastle United, Juventus, a referee, or possibly just being the uniform Build A Bear sells. There have been articles recently that 2 Premier League players are set to come out as gay. Are RBB and SBB giving a nod to that news?

The rainbow ball that SBB is sitting on gets the spin treatment today. What's with all the spinning lately?

It isn't clear whether the 2nd sticker is green or yellow. Hopefully we'll get a better picture. What color do you think it is? ...new picture, looks yellow - do you agree or disagree?

After the concert, RBB [tweeted](){:target="_blank"} a picture showing that the other sticker is clearly green. Now everybody go figure out who's holding RBB!
