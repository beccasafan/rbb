Right before the concert, an "official" twitter account was discovered. The account was followed first by Josh (the drummer) and the profile and header pictures were pictures the fandom had not seen. The account's [first tweet](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/652891111455870976){:target="_blank"} was a picture of rainbow pizza, from a [story about an Indiana pizza shop that won't provide pizzas for a gay wedding](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/04/indiana-pizza-joint-says-they-wont-cater-to-gay-weddings-internet-explodes/){:target="_blank"}.

Questions that hopefully we can get some better pictures to answer ([let me know your thoughts]({{ site.baseurl }}contribute)!):

- What is underneath RBBâ€™s right foot.
- What kind of money is below RBB in front of the chair
- Who is in the photo in the picture frame (later discovered to be [Steve Phillips (Stella Artois)]({{site.baseurl}}props/steve-phillips){:target="_blank"})
- What color is each of the stickers?
- Is the menu from a real restaurant / clearer pics of actual text
