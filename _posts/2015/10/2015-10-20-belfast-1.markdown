The official RBB/SBB account [posted a picture](https://twitter.com/Rbbsbbofficial/status/656431385842962432){:target="_blank"} of a rainbow handprint. The fandom sourced the image to [We Heart It](http://weheartit.com/entry/109446801){:target="_blank"}. It is currently believed that this is the first in a series of images counting down to the 25th of October.
