The book is Claire Richards autobiography. She "reveals the secrets of the music industry and what it's really like to be in a band at the top of their career". She also has "gotten into it" with Simon Cowell because he said he wanted to "find better people". This is theorized as how Simon will "attack" 1D, saying he let them go because they were fading and that he found a better act to work with.

The picture in the frame is of John Inman. His catch-phrase is "I'm freeeee". The BBC claimed that John, and previously mentioned Larry Grayson were just waiting for the right woman because they couldn't be openly gay.
