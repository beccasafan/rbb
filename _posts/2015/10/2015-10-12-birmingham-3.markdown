Whoever is in charge of the bears must be aware that the fandom was unable to figure out who was in the photo frame from the [first Birmingham concert]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015/10/2015-10-10-birmingham-1 %}){:target="_blank"} because the same photo was featured again today. While the fandom is still unable to find the exact picture that was used somewhere online, speculation has led to Laurie Williams. Laurie was "the godfather of the early gay scene in Birmingham" and started the Jug club. Jug, aka Just Us Guys and later Just Us Gays. This could possibly tie to Irving Azoff and his annual Just Us Guys "boys night". Williams advocated gay rights behind the scenes.

RBB is holding an advertisement for a Railcard promotion called Two Together Railcard, which gives a discount for buying tickets for a pair. Fandom speculation wonders if we might get a Lairport when the boys go to Dublin for their next concerts. Other speculation is that this refers to Harry appearing on Georgia Fowler's snapchat at a Soho House being a stunt and the bears warning us.

Aside from that, we have both a green and blue happy sticker. The blue sticker has eyelashes drawn on. Hi, Chop Suey.
