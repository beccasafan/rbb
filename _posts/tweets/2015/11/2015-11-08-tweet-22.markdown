RBB seems to be in a car again today, but this photo is cropped very tightly. Black seats with beige piping. The fandom was unable to determine the car (and who it might belong to) from the tightly cropped photo.

The [gold crown]({{site.baseurl}}props/gold-crown){:target="_blank"} has both the blue and green gems facing forward, instead of the green gem being front and center.

The last time that RBB [tweeted]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url tweets/2015/11/2015-11-04-tweet-21 %}){:target="_blank"}, he was also in a car. It was later discovered that Louis travelled to Vancouver that day. After Vancouver, he went to Atlanta, and has now returned to London. What a coincidence we got another pic of RBB today, eh?
