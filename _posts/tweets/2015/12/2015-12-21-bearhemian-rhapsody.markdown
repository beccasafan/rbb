RBB and SBB have friends! [Brown Bear]({{site.baseurl}}props/third-bear){:target="_blank"} has been seen before, but the [Peace & Friendship Bear (PFB)]({{site.baseurl}}props/pfb){:target="_blank"} is new! The bears formation and the pun *Bearhemian Rhapsody* reference the Queen Song *Bohemian Rhapsody*.

While [Freddie Mercury]({{site.baseurl}}props/freddie-mercury){:target="_blank"} never officially came out, it is [widely thought](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3288070/How-Freddie-Mercury-came-baffling-lyrics-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Biographer-says-singer-penned-famous-rock-song-confess-sexuality.html){:target="_blank"} that that is what Freddie wrote this song as. Go [read the lyrics](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tlzk4yvgz5a5bcf2que3c3s3tyi?lyrics=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=lyrics&pcampaignid=kp-lyrics){:target="_blank"} and [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ){:target="_blank"}, and focus on the implications and inner struggle they contain.
