RBB has posted a "Throwback Thursday" picture from the [Cape Town]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url concerts/2015/04/2015-04-01-cape-town %}){:target="_blank"} show. Fan pictures indicate that the guys are filming Carpool Karaoke with James Corden for the Late Late Show airing tonight. Is this a hint for what songs will be part of that segment?
