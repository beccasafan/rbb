RBB has posted a "Throwback Thursday" picture from the [Cape Town]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url concerts/2015/04/2015-04-01-cape-town %}){:target="_blank"} show. Fan pictures indicate that the guys are filming Carpool Karaoke with James Corden for the Late Late Show airing tonight. Is this a hint for what songs will be part of that segment?

Turns out this might have been a warning to the fandom. A few hours after the tweet, [EW posted an interview with Josh Devine](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/03/one-direction-drummer-josh-devine-interview){:target="_blank"}, the band's drummer. The print article contains Josh any involvement or significance to RBB/SBB, saying that it is one of the stage crew behind it, it is as far from the band as possible, and it is just the fans and their conspiracy theories assigning meaning to the whole thing. Seriously. Even better though, the lead picture on the article is a picture of Josh and RBB that [Josh posted to his own Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/1EaHXqub1e/?taken-by=joshdevinedrums){:target="_blank"}. So was this throwback picture from RBB to warn us about the denial and tell us that they're still here for us?
