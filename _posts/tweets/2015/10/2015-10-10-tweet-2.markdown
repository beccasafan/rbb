The 'official' twitter account might actually be official. We've now got a tweet of RBB in his concert outfit, but after the concert in a different setting. Hard to fake by fans!

RBB is against a brick wall with what looks like brick flooring. The fandom speculated that perhaps instead of a brick wall, we should think of [Stonewall](http://unintentionalarry.tumblr.com/post/130986224765/stonewall-means-fight-back){:target="_blank"}. Is RBB telling us that he and SBB are fighting back?
