RBB went out clubbing!!! The fandom discovered that drag queens [@boosutcliffe](https://twitter.com/boosutcliffe){:target="_blank"} and [@AmberCadaverous](https://twitter.com/ambercadaverous){:target="_blank"} are pictured with RBB, at Missing, one of Birmingham's gay village's most popular bars.

Yes, the fandom tweeted them asking who brought RBB. No, they didn't answer.
