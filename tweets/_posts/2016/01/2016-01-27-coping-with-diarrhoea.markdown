Amidst fandom chaos with Briana's (and Louis'?) baby, Harry switching management companies (and rumors of going solo yet again in the process), and just general fandom meltdown, RBB and SBB are back with a bathroom/cleaning setup! The setup today is similar to [Toronto]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-08-20-toronto %}){:target="_blank"}. Perhaps well get denials in the next couple days, and maybe even some confirmations too soon?!

The bears haven't been using [stickers]({{site.baseurl}}props/stickers){:target="_blank"} much lately, so it's absolutely wonderful to see the green and blue stickers, and they're both happy!

This time, RBB is the one on the toilet, and SBB is in charge of the [toilet-bowl-brush]({{site.baseurl}}props/toilet-bowl-brush){:target="_blank"}. The book *Coping with Diarrhoea* (that's the British spelling) appears to be homemade. Could they be more extra? (I'm somewhat scared to ask that...they'll prove me wrong...)

The book might be British, but notice the electrical outlet/plug/socket in the bottom right. That's a North American outlet. Harry and Louis (and Liam) have been in the US for a bit now, but there's been fandom speculation that RBB and SBB had a photoshoot at home in the UK and they've been releasing photos as needed. Given that, it's a bit interesting to have a photo that's more likely to have been taken in LA than the UK.
