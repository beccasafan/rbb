Amid rumors of a permanent breakup, that a rep has already denied, both RBB and SBB are with us today! Only a permanent breakup has been denied, but not resigning with Syco hasn't been denied. Iiiiinteresting! Also, t's been a while since we've seen the little guy!

RBB looks ready for business, but SBB looks more ready for a fight. SBB is a bit interesting with the whole levitation thing going on. Is he flying? *If I could fly...?* Is he ascending? Is he rising? Is his spiky belt going to protect him from the smear campaign? Just remember, nobody can drag him down!

The tie is checkered. With the end of One Direction's business relationship with Syco, could this be referencing a checkered past with them?

Do all of the stickers represent a mix of emotions as they end one chapter and begin another?
