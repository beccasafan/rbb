The bears kind of share the [bowtie]({{ site.baseurl }}props/sparkly-bowtie){:target="_blank"}, really.

RBB is wearing a [Do I Look Like I Fly Economy]({{site.baseurl}}props/do-i-look-like-i-fly-economy-button){:target="_blank"} button. Fan reports from the filming of the Jonathan Ross Show on the 11th revealed that the boys played a game of Never Have I Ever. During this game, it was revealed that Louis, Harry, and Liam are part of the Mile High club. The fandom then went on about Larry head-canons and tiny airplane bathrooms. Are the bears trying to tell us that private planes have bigger bathrooms? Hrm...

SBB is wearing a [shower cap]({{site.baseurl}}props/shower-cap){:target="_blank"}. The only other time we've seen a shower cap used as a prop was the [Singapore concert]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-03-11-singapore %}){:target="_blank"}. At that show, RBB had shower/cleaning props, which possibly were a nod to cleaning up the Elounor relationship. It was the closest show that RBB was at for when the breakup is said to have happened.
