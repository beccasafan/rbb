RBB made the trip to Mexico with the guys! RBB is in his 'standard' Teddy Mercury outfit. RBB would also like everyone to know that he still does not fly economy.

The reflection in the sunglasses/crown is only blurred where the person/people taking the picture is. Part of the fandom think they can see a person in the reflection of the green vase, but there's no consensus. Some see someone sitting in spot, others see someone standing in a different part of the reflection. Some see SBB being held on the person's hip, on the person's shoulder, or on a box.

In case anyone was unsure if this was in Mexico, RBB and SBB changed their Twitter location to Mexico. Wouldn't want anyone confused, right?
