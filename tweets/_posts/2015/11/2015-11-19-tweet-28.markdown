On the Jimmy Kimmel show tonight, Jimmy introduce the new member of One Direction. A potato. Yes, you read that right. Jimmy introduced a potato, created social media accounts for it, and encouraged fans to like the photo. Then he proceeded to make fun of how many likes the photo was getting. Okay?? The fandom discussed mashing the potato, and lookie here. RBB and SBB are making themselves some mashed potatoes!
