RBB and SBB are celebrating the holidays by sending Christmas gifts. Oh man, do they hold a grudge! They are sending the [1D Potato]({{site.baseurl}}props/1d-potato){:target="_blank"}, from the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, a potato peeler and a potato masher. YIKES! The potato originally represented JKL making fun of the fans, but it could also represent a more general nod to the fandom manipulation that has occurred for years, coming from 1DHQ.

SBB is sitting in the [salon chair]({{site.baseurl}}props/salon-chair){:target="_blank"}, which possibly has alluded to girlfriends/beards in the past. Is this a nod to Louelle? Or did SBB just need comfortable seating and didn't want to sit on the floor?

And then we have the handwriting. It is speculated that *RBB* and *SBB* are written in different handwriting. People have also compared a few pieces of handwriting. The wedding card is Harry or Louis. (There's a post about how Louis draws his speech bubbles like that, so possibly his handwriting too, but I can't find that post right now. Link anyone??). The second picture is Harry's journal.

Some folks have also taken notice that the card bears some resemblance to [gifts that have appeared](http://beccasafan.tumblr.com/post/135862229442){:target="_blank"} under the Tomlinson Christmas tree and also with Harry somewhere. Side-eye upon side-eye!
