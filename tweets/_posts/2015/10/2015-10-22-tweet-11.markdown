The official RBB/SBB account posted a picture of three porridge bowls saying "Too Hot!", "Too Cold!", and "THA...Just Right". These reference [Goldilocks and the Three Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_and_the_Three_Bears){:target="_blank"}. The story is about how the bears are trusting, and a girl invades their house to eat their food and sleep in their beds. Fandom speculation wonders if this refers to Babygate. There is also [an analysis](http://sexatoxbridge.tumblr.com/post/131688142308/dorien-grey-and-me-goldilocks-aka-the-source){:target="_blank"} that looks at the source for this particular image and possible *coincidences*. Also of possible note is that the three bowls are the same as the color of stickers that have been used. It is currently believed that this is part of a series of images counting down to the 25th of October.
