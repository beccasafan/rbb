RBB hung out with a friend after the [Newcastle 2]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-10-26-newcastle-2 %}){:target="_blank"} show! The fandom was unable to determine who this person is. Turns out, it seems to be the *where* and not the *who* that is important here...

During the concert, the fandom was divided over what color stickers RBB had on his shoes. This picture after the show put that discussion to rest, making it very clear that it was a green sticker.

Observant fans noticed that this picture was taken at Sunset Boulevard, a gay bar located in the 'Gay Village' or 'Pink Triangle'. Fun thing about this - Louis partied at Digital, which is a literal couple minute walk from Sunset Boulevard. Not saying it means anything, just saying that RBB and Louis were both partying a few minutes away from each other.
