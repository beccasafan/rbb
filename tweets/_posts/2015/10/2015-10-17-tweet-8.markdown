Posted prior to the concert, the bears are honoring the Irish today! RBB is wearing an [Irish Step Dancer costume]({{site.baseurl}}props/irish-step-dancer-costume){:target="_blank"}, and Sugar Baby Bear has a [green sparkly fedora]({{site.baseurl}}props/green-sparkly-fedora){:target="_blank"}. We can also see a [green happy sticker]({{site.baseurl}}props/green-happy-sticker){:target="_blank"}. The bears apparently got all dressed up with nowhere to go, because they were not at the concert.
