The bears are coming out of hibernation. But what does that mean, exactly? There's *the thing*...but it's probably not that. The beginning of it? The bears showing up at the show tonight? Something changing with management? Something else changing behind the scenes? When is the 'Dummy's Guide to RBB and SBB' being released???!

Fandom speculation seems to be focusing on the idea that this doesn't mean Louis and Harry will actually come out tonight, but that perhaps this is the start of it. Will they interact on stage? Will we see them together outside of concerts? Will they get papped together? I guess we'll just have to wait and see!

The use of the Chicago Bears logo has intrigued some fans, given their rivalry to the Green Bay Packers (Harry's team). The image is a top search result for "bears coming out", so I think it's a happy coincidence. The Bears use it as the start of each season, implying that the off-season is when they were hibernating and now they're ready to play (American) football.
