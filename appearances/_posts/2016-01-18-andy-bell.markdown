New profile icon! Now featured is Andy Bell, from Erasure. He is openly gay, and has said several times that while he won't go out of his way to talk about it, he won't hide it and will use his music to take a stance.

[This picture is from a concert in NYC on Dec 31st, 2014](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fdetail%2Fnews-photo%2Fandy-bell-and-vince-clarke-of-erasure-perform-at-terminal-5-news-photo%2F460948234&t=NTVmYTlhZTAzMjhhZTU4Y2ZiNTUwZjgwMjZhN2U0NTJkZTcxZTBjZCxDajdGWnRONg%3D%3D){:target="_blank"}.

There has been not-entirely-serious fandom speculation that Louis and Harry are planning a wedding, based on recent locations they've been spotted at: bakery, jewelry store, reception venue, church. Could "bell" be a hint? Andy bell also performed "A little respect" in the musical Our Gay Wedding - is that another nod to fandom speculation?
