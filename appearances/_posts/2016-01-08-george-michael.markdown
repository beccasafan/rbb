RBB changed the icon to George Michael wearing the jacket he burns in Freedom 90.

Lyrics:

> I think there’s something you should know  
> I think it’s time i told you so  
> There’s something deep inside of me  
> There’s someone else i’ve got to be  
> Take back your picture in a frame  
> Take back your singing in the rain  
> I just hope you understand  
> Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
