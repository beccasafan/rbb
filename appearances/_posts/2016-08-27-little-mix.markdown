***GUESS WHO'S BACK?!!! RBB IS BACK!!!***

The [last time we saw RBB/SBB]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-02-01-cake %}){:target="_blank"} was on February 1st, Harry's birthday. On February 12, the @Rbbsbbofficial Twitter account was deactivated.

*It's been almost 7 months.*

Today, RBB has shown up at a Little Mix concert. Note both the blue and green happy stickers! Check out [this video](https://twitter.com/mcfIeur/status/769504074312085504){:target="_blank"} taken by a fan. The concert hasn't happened yet, but RBB was out there hours before.

A week ago, Louis liked a picture of a Little Mix concert that Perrie posted. For more context, [here's a post with some details/pics](https://beccasafan.tumblr.com/post/149558668792){:target="_blank"}.
