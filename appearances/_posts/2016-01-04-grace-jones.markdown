RBB/SBB's new Twitter profile pic is from when [Grace Jones appeared on the Russell Harty Barmy show](https://youtu.be/VpWo15Jc2JQ){:target="_blank"}. [This article](http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/26483/1/the-real-reason-grace-jones-whacked-a-tv-host-live-on-air){:target="_blank"} discusses her perspective on the appearance. Jones says that Russell kept turning his back on her, that she was treated like hired help, that Russell was poking fun at her, it being said that she was causing a scene. Jones felt provoked, poked Russell in the back, and said *"this has been going on too long already".*

The screenshot that RBB/SBB posted is of the moment Grace says *This has been going on too long already.*

In fandom current events, Briana's family and fans have recently been speaking up about Louis abandoning Briana, ignoring Briana and dating Danielle, and claiming that Louis is like his father (birth father Troy who abondoned Jay and Louis 10 days after Louis' birth). Today on Twitter, Jay defended Louis, sharing [how he treats his family](http://lhrry.tumblr.com/post/136626693613/i-love-her){:target="_blank"}, sharing [a few stories on charitable things that he's done behind the scenes](http://lhrry.tumblr.com/post/136627141878/40116){:target="_blank"}, and [an adorable picture of her with 6-year old Louis](http://lhrry.tumblr.com/post/136627714498){:target="_blank"}. The fandom speculates that Jay was indirecting and shading the smear campaign, and that this profile image change is also shading the smear campaign and the overall situation itself.

On a related note, when the guys were doing TV appearances for MITAM promo, [The Mirror posted a smear article](http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/one-direction-demand-grace-jones-6845239){:target="_blank"} alleging that they had Jones removed from appearing as a guest on the same episode of the Jonathan Ross show because they didn't want to be overshadowed by her. A source claimed that this shows how arrogant 1D is, and that Jones flew from Jamaica specifically for the show. Jones had a book signing in London the day after the show taping, so her trip was not only for the Jonathan Ross show. A rep for 1D denied the claims.

On a possibly related note, Samantha Perlman recently posted [this Instagram picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/_of02Al2XW/?taken-by=sperelxo){:target="_blank"} featuring [Divine]({{site.baseurl}}props/divine){:target="_blank"} and [Grace Jones]({{site.baseurl}}props/grace-jones){:target="_blank"}. Samantha Perlman is the daughter of Ronald Perlman. Ronald is the owner of the C2 yacht that the Azoffs, Harry, Kendall, and Ellen have been vacationing on. The trip has seen Hendall highly publicized with a near constant stream of pap pics and promo from E! and Keeping Up With the Kardashians social media. An interesting coincidence, at least!
