The profile image has changed again, meaning that the [birthday]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-12-24-birthday %}){:target="_blank"} was only up for the 24th. Yup. Ok.

The new profile image features Army of Lovers, a Swedish band. There are a number of interesting things about Army of Lovers. The name of the band alludes to a documentary on gay rights activist Rosa von Praunheim. Alexander Bard is gay, and also a judge on Swedish Idol. 1D likely met him when they performed there in 2014. They have been very outspoken in their opposition to homophobia and have headlined Pride festivities. They have had several videos banned from MTV for being "high camp". They were known for their outlandish costumes, camp videos, and have promoted same-sex marriage.

As a fun coincidence, they have a single titled *Love Me Like a Loaded Gun*
