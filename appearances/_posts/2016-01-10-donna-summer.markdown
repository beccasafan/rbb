RBB/SBB changed their profile icon to Donna Summer. The photo is used for a number of things, but one is cover art for MacArthur Park. The song contains the following lyrics

> MacArthur’s Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don’t think that I can take it  
‘cause it took so long to bake it  
And I’ll never have that recipe again  
Oh, nooooo  

This comes after rumored spottings of Harry with Louis at a bakery in London today. There have been no pictures so far, and a few of the spottings have been confirmed as trolls, but it's possible the first report was real. Interesting timing and coincidence with this profile image change! Profile image changes are often followed by a tweet, so let's see if we get anything and how that relates...

Also interesting about Donna Summer, [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer){:target="_blank"}:

> After the release of the On the Radio album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and Casablanca Records. Casablanca wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President Neil Bogart over the early release of the single "No More Tears (Enough is Enough)"; she had penned "Dim All the Lights" alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Not waiting until "Dim All the Lights" had peaked, or at least another month as promised; Summer felt it had detracted from the singles chart momentum. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with Geffen Records, the new label started by David Geffen. Summer had filed a 10-million-dollar suit against Casablanca; the label counter-sued. In the end, she did not receive any money, but won the rights to her own lucrative song publishing.
