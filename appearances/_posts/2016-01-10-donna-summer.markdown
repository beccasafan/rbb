RBB/SBB changed their profile icon to Donna Summer. The photo is used for a number of things, but one is cover art for MacArthur Park. The song contains the following lyrics

> MacArthur’s Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don’t think that I can take it  
‘cause it took so long to bake it  
And I’ll never have that recipe again  
Oh, nooooo  

This comes after rumored spottings of Harry with Louis at a bakery in London today. There have been no pictures so far, and a few of the spottings have been confirmed as trolls, but it's possible the first report was real. Interesting timing and coincidence with this profile image change! Profile image changes are often followed by a tweet, so let's see if we get anything and how that relates...

Also interesting about Donna Summer, [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer){:target="_blank"}:  

> In the mid-1980s, Summer was embroiled in a controversy. She allegedly had made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease, AIDS, which as a result had a significantly negative impact on her career. Summer, by this time a born-again Christian, was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals.[34][35] Some years later, Summer publicly denied that she had ever made any such comment, and in a letter to the AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989 said it was "a terrible misunderstanding." In explaining why she did not respond to Act Up sooner, Summer stated "I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters. If I have caused you pain, forgive me." She closed her letter with Bible quotes (from Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians).

> After the release of the On the Radio album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and Casablanca Records. Casablanca wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President Neil Bogart over the early release of the single "No More Tears (Enough is Enough)"; she had penned "Dim All the Lights" alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Not waiting until "Dim All the Lights" had peaked, or at least another month as promised; Summer felt it had detracted from the singles chart momentum. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with Geffen Records, the new label started by David Geffen. Summer had filed a 10-million-dollar suit against Casablanca; the label counter-sued. In the end, she did not receive any money, but won the rights to her own lucrative song publishing.
